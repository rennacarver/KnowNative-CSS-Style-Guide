Introduction

Hello Team! Here youâ€™ll find a quick guide on CSS for the KnowNative app. KnowNative uses SASS with SCSS syntax and BEM as the naming convention. We use BEM very loosely here. The only rule we enforce is that all class names must be prefixed by the component name. This prevents class name conflicts.

Getting Started

Installation

SASS is likely already installed. If not, follow these steps in the terminal to bring SASS into your project:

cd client
npm install

Converting a CSS file to SASS

All the files in the project should already have the .scss extension. If not, simply rename the file from

.css to .scss

SCSS files interpret vanilla CSS automatically. The build tool (currently Vite) will also automatically watch these files and compile them to CSS in the background as you make changes.

Rule One

All class names must be prefixed by the component name

ðŸš« These class names can lead to problems because title is a repeated class and pollutes the namespace.

<!-- Card Component -->
<div class="card">
  <h2 class="title">Card Title</h2>
</div>

<!-- Modal Component -->
<div class="modal">
  <h2 class="title">Modal Title</h2>
</div>

âœ… Much better!

<!-- Card Component -->
<div class="card">
  <h2 class="card__title">Card Title</h2>
</div>

<!-- Modal Component -->
<div class="modal">
  <h2 class="modal__title">Modal Title</h2>
</div>

\*\*the double underscore \_\_ is a BEM naming convention. Learn more about BEM below.

Rule Two

When creating SASS variables, use $ instead of --var.

Both syntaxes are valid. The SASS syntax has been chosen to ensure consistency and conciseness across the codebase.

ðŸš« Vanilla CSS syntax can be verbose

:root {
--primary-color: #3498db;
--font-size-large: 1.5rem;
--spacing-unit: 16px;
}
button {
background-color: var(--primary-color);
font-size: var(--font-size-large);
padding: var(--spacing-unit);
}

âœ… Much better!

$primary-color: #3498db;
$font-size-large: 1.5rem;
$spacing-unit: 16px;

button {
background-color: $primary-color;
font-size: $font-size-large;
}

Rule Three

Keep specificity low

Avoid nesting

Use classes instead of tags and IDs

Letâ€™s say you have a table with these style rules:

td.data { background-color: white }
td.summary { background-color: yellow }

However, in another component, you need to redefine the background of a particular cell:

.final-summary { background-color: green }

This wouldnâ€™t work because tag.class always has a higher specificity than just .class.

You would add a tag name to the rule to make it work:

td.final-summary { background-color: green }

FAQs

Whatâ€™s SASS?

Sass, or Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets, is a CSS pre-processor. SASS Basics

Why do we need SASS?

CSS has a lot of modern features but browser support is often missing. Nesting, mixins, loops, and functions are all available to use but many browsers do not render this CSS correctly.

CSS pre-processors like SASS take these advanced features and compile them into vanilla CSS that can be rendered correctly by a majority of browsers.

Whatâ€™s the difference between SASS and SCSS?

SASS has two different syntaxes. The first is .sass and the second is .scss. KnowNative uses the SCSS syntax.

The great thing about SCSS is that it accepts vanilla CSS. This means developers can continue to write CSS as they always have and bring in advanced SASS features only as needed.

SCSS Syntax - uses {} and ; - accepts vanilla CSS

.primary-navigation {
padding: 1rem;
ul {
display: flex;
gap: 1rem;
list-style: none;
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
}
a {
text-transform: uppercase;
text-decoration: none;
}
}

SASS Syntax - more concise - doesnâ€™t accept vanilla CSS

.primary-navigation
padding: 1rem
ul
display: flex
gap: 1rem
list-style: none
margin: 0
padding: 0
a
text-transform: uppercase
text-decoration: none

Whatâ€™s BEM?

BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a naming convention for classes in HTML and CSS. Basically, it is a methodology to help write more readable CSS code. Introduction to BEM

Why do we need BEM?

BEM prevents class name conflicts and helps keep code more organized.

Consider this example:

HTML

<div class="card card--light">
   <img class="card__image src="https://unsplash.it/300 alt="">
   <h2>I'm a light card</h2>
   <p class="card__body">And here would be the content of my card</p>
</div>

<div class="card card--dark">
   <img class="card__image src="https://unsplash.it/300 alt="">
   <h2>I'm a dark card</h2>
   <p class="card__body">And here would be the content of my card</p>
</div>

CSS

.card {
margin: 2em;
max-width: 300px;
padding: 2em;
box-shadow: 0 10px 30px -10px rgba(0,0,0..45);
}

.card--light {
background: #eee
color: black;
}

.card--dark {
background: #333;
color: white;
}

This example was pulled from Kevin Powellâ€™s excellent tutorial: link here

Explanation:

Each of the cards is a block (parent)

The image is an element (child) of the card and is thus prefixed by the parent name card and a double underscore \_\_

Variants of a block or element are called modifiers and are prefixed by a double hyphen --

Try it yourself:

If we wanted to add a new subtitle to both cards and one cardâ€™s subtitle is red, we can name the new CSS class as

card\_\_subtitle--red

As mentioned above, KnowNative is not super strict with the BEM naming convention. BEM is more of a guide to make writing CSS class names easier and more readable. If you would like to learn more about BEM, take a look at the best practices section below.

Best Practices

Using SASS to prefix all class names with the component name

Manually prefixing all CSS class names with the component name can be tedious. Thankfully SASS has a feature that makes it much easier. Hereâ€™s how nesting and the & selector can make CSS code more readable:

Pre-compiled .scss file

.card {
background-color: #fff;
border: 1px solid #ddd;
&**header {
font-size: 1.5em;
padding: 10px;
}
&**body {
padding: 15px;
&--highlighted {
background-color: #f0f8ff;
}
}
&\_\_footer {
padding: 10px;
text-align: right;
}
}

Compiled .css file

.card {
background-color: #fff;
border: 1px solid #ddd;
}
.card**header {
font-size: 1.5em;
padding: 10px;
}
.card**body {
padding: 15px;
}
.card**body--highlighted {
background-color: #f0f8ff;
}
.card**footer {
padding: 10px;
text-align: right;
}

Explanation:

The & syntax in SASS refers to the parent selector, creating prefixed class names.

The \_\_ (double underscore) syntax is used for elements inside the parent selector.

The -- (double hyphen) syntax is used for modifiers such as --highlighted or --active .

This method ensures all classes within .card are properly namespaced.

Avoid â€˜grandchildâ€™ selectors with multiple underscores \_\_

If an Element is nested two levels deep inside of a Block, just use a one double underscore \_\_

ðŸš« Multiple underscores

<div class="c-card">
    <div class="c-card__header">
        <!-- Here comes the grandchildâ€¦ -->
        <h2 class="c-card__header__title">Title text here</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="c-card__body">
        <img class="c-card__body__img" src="some-img.png" alt="description">
        <p class="c-card__body__text">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur</p>
        <p class="c-card__body__text">Adipiscing elit.
            <a href="/somelink.html" class="c-card__body__text__link">Pellentesque amet</a>
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

âœ…

<div class="c-card">
    <div class="c-card__header">
        <h2 class="c-card__title">Title text here</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="c-card__body">
        <img class="c-card__img" src="some-img.png" alt="description">
        <p class="c-card__text">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur</p>
        <p class="c-card__text">Adipiscing elit.
            <a href="/somelink.html" class="c-card__link">Pellentesque amet</a>
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

Flat selectors

Access all elements through classes

Avoid nesting more than two levels deep

Avoid idâ€™s (specificity is too high and is hard to overwrite further down in the cascade)

Avoid tags (tags are low specificity however tags donâ€™t have meaning. class names are preferred)

(need a picture of good and bad selectors) Renna

Naming should be clear enough to not need comments

Nesting can cause problems

Things can get very messy if you aren't careful when creating descendant selectors or using the parent selector & to create compund selectors.

A general rule of thumb is trying to stick to a maximum of 2 or 3 nesting levels deep.

Nesting can make your code harder to search, because the classes in your Sass do not match the selectors in the compiles CSS file.
